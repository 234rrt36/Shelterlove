          >It started for Praveen in 2013, when he rescued a kitten with a
          spinal injury. He nursed it at home, but it passed away after a week,
          leaving Praveen to wonder what he could do to help numerous animals
          like this, that suffer in silence. So he started by rescuing injured
          animals, and keeping them at home. Soon, as the number of rescues
          increased, he started looking for temporary shelters to house them.
          Eventually, the news of his rescue got around and he started attending
          to approximately 4-5 cases in a day were People Use to tag him in
          social media Like Facebook etc. He took the help of Dr. Girish from
          Blue Cross and Dr. Lohith frm Maruthi pet clinic and started an
          account in their respective clinics, so that injured animals could be
          attended to, without a delay due to the finances. So as the number of
          rescues went up, so did the bill amount in the clinics. But that did
          not deter Praveen.</span
